Design a mobile iOS app called FlightFuel with a professional aviation-themed UI, inspired by electronic flight bags (EFB) and glass cockpits.
The app is a nutrition, hydration, and supplement decision-support tool for pilots, using pilot language and checklist-style layouts.
Visual style:
Dark cockpit-style background (charcoal/graphite)
Subtle panel borders like avionics modules
Primary accent: avionics green (OK / normal status)
Secondary accent: amber (advisories)
Clean, minimal, premium — not gamified
Typography similar to modern aviation systems; use monospaced fonts for data blocks
Tone & language:
Professional, procedural, aviation-specific
Use terms like: Flight Deck, Flight Plan, Fuel Strategy, Fluid Load, Advisories, Duty, Recovery
Avoid medical or prescriptive language
Bottom navigation (4 tabs):
Flight Deck
Plan
Fuel Scan
Log
Flight Deck (Home Screen):
Header titled “FLIGHT DECK”
Main status card labeled “TODAY’S FLIGHT PLAN” showing:
Duty Start (LT)
Duty Type
Conditions
Operating Mode (Performance / Maintain / Cut)
Checklist-style cards:
Fuel Strategy
Fluid Load
Optional Performance Aids (Educational)
An amber “ADVISORIES” panel with short, calm notices
Plan Screen:
Vertical duty timeline (Pre-duty, During Duty, Post-duty, Recovery)
Each phase shows guidance using categories (not specific foods or dosages)
Fuel Scan Screen (Camera Feature):
Dark cockpit-style camera UI
Central reticle overlay
Button labeled “FUEL SCAN”
After scanning, show a results screen with:
Detected food items (editable)
Confidence indicator (Low / Medium / High)
Portion selector (Small / Medium / Large)
“Estimated” calories and macros clearly labeled as estimates
Button: “ADD TO FLIGHT PLAN”
Include text noting estimates are educational and not medical advice
Log Screen:
Minimal status monitoring:
Weight trend
Sleep hours
Energy level (1–5)
Clean, cockpit-style charts
General requirements:
No medical claims
No supplement dosages
Use educational, non-prescriptive wording everywhere
UI should feel like a cockpit tool, not a fitness app
Optimized for iOS look and feel
Create clean, production-ready UI screens following this system.
